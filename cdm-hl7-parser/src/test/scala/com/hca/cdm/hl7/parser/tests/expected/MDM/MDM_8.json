    "obsv_value": "Coronary Artery Disease~Coronary artery disease (CAD) is a process in which the blood vessels of the~heart (coronary arteries) become narrow or blocked. The narrowing or blockage~can lead to decreased blood flow to the heart muscle (angina). Prolonged reduced~blood flow can cause a heart attack (myocardial infarction, MI). Because CAD is~the leading cause of death in men, it is important to understand what causes~this condition and how it is treated.~CAUSES~Atherosclerosis is the cause of CAD. This is the buildup of fat and cholesterol~(plaque) on the inside of the arteries. Over time, the plaque may narrow or~block the artery, and this will lessen blood flow to the heart. Plaque can also~become weak and break off within a coronary artery to form a clot and cause a~sudden blockage.~RISK FACTORS~Many risk factors increase your chances of getting CAD, including:~? High cholesterol levels.~? High blood pressure (hypertension).~? Tobacco use.~? Diabetes.~? Age. Men over age 45 are at a greater risk of CAD.~? Gender. Men often develop CAD earlier in life than women.~? Family history of CAD.~? Obesity.~? Lack of exercise.~? A diet high in saturated fats.~SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS~Many people do not experience any symptoms during the early stages of CAD. As~the condition progresses, symptoms may include:~? Chest pain.~? The pain can be described as a crushing or squeezing in the chest, or a~tightness, pressure, fullness, or heaviness in the chest.~? The pain can last more than a few minutes or can stop and recur.?~? Pain in the arms, neck, jaw, or back.~? Unexplained heartburn or indigestion.~? Shortness of breath.~? Nausea.~? Sudden cold sweats.?~Less common symptoms of CAD in men can include:~? Fatigue.~? Unexplained feelings of nervousness or anxiety.~? Weakness.~? Diarrhea.~? Sudden light-headedness.~DIAGNOSIS~Tests to diagnose CAD may include:~? ECG (electrocardiogram).~? Exercise stress test. This looks for signs of blockage when the heart is being~exercised.~? Pharmacologic stress test. This test looks for signs of blockage when the~heart is being stressed with a medicine.~? Blood tests.~? Coronary angiogram. This is a procedure to look at the coronary arteries to~see if there is any blockage.~TREATMENT~The treatment of CAD may include the following:~? Healthy behavioral changes to reduce or control risk factors.~? Medicine.~? Coronary stenting.?A stent helps to keep an artery open.~? Coronary angioplasty. This procedure widens a narrowed or blocked artery.~? Coronary artery?bypass surgery. This will allow your blood to pass the~blockage (bypass) to reach your heart.~HOME CARE INSTRUCTIONS~? Take medicines only as directed by your health care provider. ?~? Manage other health conditions such as hypertension and diabetes as directed~by your health care provider.~? Follow a heart-healthy diet. A dietitian can help to educate you about healthy~food options and changes.~? Use healthy cooking methods such as roasting, grilling, broiling, baking,~poaching, steaming, or stir-frying. Talk to a dietitian to learn more about~healthy cooking methods.~? Follow an exercise program approved by your health care provider.~? Maintain a healthy weight. Lose weight as approved by your health care~provider.~? Plan rest periods when fatigued.~?

If you drink alcohol, and your health care provider approves, limit your~alcohol intake to no more than 1 drink per day. One drink equals 12 ounces of~beer, 5 ounces of wine, or 1? ounces of hard liquor.~? Stop illegal drug use.~? Your health care provider may ask you to monitor your blood pressure. A blood~pressure reading consists of a higher number over a lower number, such as 110~over 72, which is written as 110/72. Ideally, your blood pressure should be:~? Below 140/90 if you have no other medical conditions.~? Below 130/80 if you have diabetes or kidney disease.~? Keep all follow-up visits as directed by your health care provider. This is~important.~SEEK IMMEDIATE MEDICAL CARE IF:~? You have pain in your chest, neck, arm, jaw, stomach, or back that lasts more~than a few minutes, is recurring, or is unrelieved by taking medicine under your~tongue (sublingual?nitroglycerin).~? You have profuse sweating without cause.~? You have unexplained:~? Heartburn or indigestion.~? Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing.~? Nausea or vomiting.~? Fatigue.~? Feelings of nervousness or anxiety.~? Weakness.~? Diarrhea.~? You have sudden light-headedness or dizziness.~? You faint.~These symptoms may represent a serious problem that is an emergency.
